# About {-}

Welcome to Microbial Mysteries, a Course-based Undergraduate Research Experience (CURE) that takes you on a genomics adventure from soil to gut!

This CURE allows students to develop a project using genomics datasets from environments such as human gut and soil, and learn how organisms, high-throughput sequencing, and the scientific process are used in both basic and clinical research.

### Learning Goals {-}

- **Navigate biological databases** - access the wealth of publically available scientific knowledge and data (e.g. NCBI).
- **Analyze Big Data** - e.g. plot and interpret results from next generation sequencing (NGS) experiment.
- **Gain skills in computational and bioinformatics data analysis** - e.g. web-based platforms or command-line bioingofmatics tools (e.g. Galaxy, R).
- **Practice the scientific process and critical thinking** -  learing to read and evaluate scientific literature, ask questions, identify avenues for research, design experiments, analyze and interpret data, and integrating results into the broader scientific discourse.
- **Engage in scientific research** - Apply knowledge and skills learned to complete a project using existing datasets to ask new questions, generate novel conclusions and create and present a Final Poster.
