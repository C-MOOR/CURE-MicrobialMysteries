The vast majority of all microorganisms on Earth and beyond remain uncultured. As a result, their genomes (or metagenomes) are underdetected and understudied. As such, metagenomics is the 'black box' of genomics. Curiosity and threat of microbes are a great driving force behind the advances in the study of metagenomics, which is a culture-independent, direct approach to microbial sequencing and analysis of an environmental sample.

In this module, we will learn about microbial diversity, the field of genomics and metagenomics and the role of sequencing technologies in metagenomic analysis. We will also learn how to read a scientific paper! In **Prelab** we will read a metagenomics **Review paper** to obtain a birds eye view of metagenomics from soil to gut and get an appreciation of the diversity and complexity of microorganisms, and of the challenges associated with identifying microorganisms. In **Project** activity, we will go deeper into scientific literature by reading a recent metagenomics **Research paper** and dissecting it from A to Z.

## Pre-lab - Scientific Literature

### Purpose 

Obtain a high level overview of metagenomics by reading
R.D. Sleator, C. Shortall, and C. Hill.  Metagenomics.  Letters in Applied Microbiology. 2008 Nov;47(5):361-6. [(pubmed.gov/19146522)](http://pubmed.gov/19146522)

### Learning Objectives 

- Read a review paper that summarizes the field of metagenomics.
- Broadly understand the scope of the review and the gaps in the field. 

### Introduction 

The vast majority of all micro-organisms on Earch remain uncultured [(K.G. Lloyd et al, 2019)](https://journals.asm.org/doi/10.1128/msystems.00055-18). Additionally, in complex environments like soil and water, most micro-organisms remain unidentified [(M. Delgado-Baquerizo, 2019)](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41396-019-0405-0). The field of metagenomics is a culture-independend approach which aims to remedy these gaps in knowledge [(J. Handelsman, 2004)](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15590779/). Metagenomics is the study of genomic (sequencing) data obtained directly from environmental (and other, e.g. clinical) samples and provides new meaningful information on the diversity and function of microorganisms.

## Project - Scientific Literature

### Purpose

Examine research on metagenomic diversity by reading Xue, *et al*. Metagenome sequencing and 103 microbial genomes from ballast water and sediments. Scientific Data.2023 Aug 10;10(1):536. [(pubmed.gov/37563185)](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37563185/)

### Learning Objectives
- Understand the purpose and experimental setup of the paper
- Understand the presented evidence (Figures and Tables) of the paper

### Introduction

Understanding microbial composition and diversity in different environments is critical for assessing the benefits and threats of the bacterial community in that environment.  In the publication by [Xue, et al. 2023](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37563185/), the authors study microbial diversity in the ballast-tank water from two ships, with the idea that such a unique and isolated water environment may select for specific microbes.  Luckily in their research they don’t find bacterium *Vibrio cholerae*, but that is exactly what they would find in the ballast water of cargo ships if they did the analysis during the cholera pandemic(s) of the 1800s.
