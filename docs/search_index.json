Course description Microorganisms surround us, from the microbes in our soil to the bacteria in our digestive systems. As part of the C-MOOR project https://www.c-moor.org, this Course-based Undergraduate Research Experience (CURE) introduces computational tools using Galaxy https://usegalaxy.org and SciServer https://sciserver.org to analyze metagenomic datasets that you will use to conduct independent projects. Dig into soil metagenomics datasets generated by the GDSCN BioDIGS consortium http://biodigs.gdscn.org and study the soil biodiversity and ecological factors that impact human health and ecological concerns or explore publicly accessible human gut metagenomics datasets https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/bioproject and study how our microbiomes are shaped by our diet, medications, and genetics. This course progresses through a series of in-person and online learning experiences that introduce important concepts and tools in data analysis and genomics, necessary to subsequently complete a Capstone Project. Students work in groups and present frequently during class periods similar to research lab meetings in order to receive and provide community analysis and feedback. This course is open to all students, regardless of major. No prior computational experience necessary. Microbial Mysteries CURE was offered at the Johns Hopkins University in the Spring of 2025 as AS.020.126.01.SP25 Microbial Mysteries: Genomics from Ground to Gut. Content overview The CURE is organized in two phases (Figure 2) which parallel our two groups of Learning Goals: (1) Employ the Tools of Modern Biology, and (2) Think Like a Scientist. Additionally, a Professional Development module is integrated into the two phases. In the first phase, five core labs teach students how to “Employ the Tools of Modern Biology”, through tutorials, exercises and group work. These tools provide a necessary foundation from which students can develop and investigate their own scientific questions. In phase 2, students learn to “Think Like a Scientist” by developing their own scientific projects. Equipped with the tools they learned in phase 1, students work in groups to generate and pursue scientific questions based on their exploration of the metagenomics data, culminating in a poster presentation. To help students succeed, we provide check-ins and structured lab times for students to work on their projects over the remainder of the course (see Project Work for details). This phase is more flexible; students benefit from dedicated lab time to work on their projects, but these opportunities for project work can be integrated into labs with short protocols or long wait periods. Microbial Mysteries CURE was offered at the Johns Hopkins University over the Spring Semester of 2025 lasting a total of 13 weeks (2 classes/sessions per week). Each class/session lasted 1 hour and 15 minutes. Course content was organized broadly into 3 categories: 1. Phase 1 Core Labs - on weekly basis, Units 0 through 4 [ weeks 1-5] 2. Phase 2: Project Work - over the course of 7-8 weeks [weeks 6-13] 3. Professional Development - over the course of 4 weeks integrated into Project Work Core units 0, 1, 2, 3 and 4, are fundamental knowledge and skills units that were taught over the coure of 5 weeks. Each core unit was typically associated with 1.5-2.5 hours of homework per class, or 3-5 hours of homework per week. The amount of homework is based on: For each hour of class students were generally expected to spend approximately 2 hours of independent study time (homework). To ensure meaningful coverage of important concepts and scientific content and computational skills necessary to proceed to next step and subsequently execute independent group project work.

During their project work that spans ~8 weeks, students do research work towards their project, prepare and update relevant documents (e.g. Written Doc, poster slide deck) and separately meet with instructor to get help with project direction and execution and ask questions. Students are expected to work on their project independently and with groups a minimum of 4 hours per week. When there is no assignment due, students are still expected to work on their projects and update their posters. Project Work activities consist of In-Class Round Table activities, Written Updates, and Advisory Meetings.

This forum will be the primary place for students, their instructors, and experts to communicate about the student’s research project, professional development opportunities, and more. 1.4.2 Learning Objectives Learn how to post to a discourse community. Examine the differences between private and public discourse categories. 1.4.3 Introduction Before beginning this assignment, you should have already made an account on the C-MOOR Academy Discussion Forum and been added to the course Category by your instructor. Within the C-MOOR community, you will find Categories, which can be either private or public. In this course we will use both. In our private category, students can talk to each other and their instructor and their conversations will not be publicly available. In the public category, students’ posts will be visible on the web. The value of public discourse communities is that you might get responses by experts that you do not know. In this assignment, students will post to both a public and private Category within the Community. 1.4.4 Activity 1 - Create a Topic in a Private Category Estimated time: 20 min 1.4.4.1 Instructions Visit the C-MOOR Academy Discussion Forum (help.c-moor.org) and log in. It is a good idea to bookmark this page so that you can easily access it throughout the course. Read through the categories in the C-MOOR Academy Discussion Forum. Notice that some categories (at least one) have a lock next to them. This is a Private category, only visible to you, your classmates and your instructor. If you cannot see your course’s private category when you log in, email your instructor so that they can add you. Click on the private category that belongs to your class: Spring 2025. In this private channel, we will add a “New Topic” in which you can introduce yourself to the class. This first post will be an introduction to your class, including a bit about you and a photo. a. Tell your group about yourself. Answer the following questions. 1. What is your name? 2. Why did you decide to take this class? What are you excited to learn about this semester? 3. Tell us one thing you like to do outside of school and work. b. Include a photo: 1. Selfie: if you would like, post a photo of yourself. 2. Unselfie: or post a photo of something else. Maybe something that you feel represents your life right now, or a picture of something you love. A pet maybe. Just make sure it tells us something about you. Play around with the platform to personalize your post. As you can see in the discourse topic, you can add emojis, upload images, embed content, etc. These features appear in plain text as you’re typing, but you can see a preview of your post on the right. For your first few posts you may see a Welcome Box on the right instead, you can close this to see the preview. Once you have posted a few times, the Welcome Box will stop appearing. When you are done, click “Create Topic” and it will post for the class to see. If other students have posted their introductions, read them and leave a couple replies. This is a discussion platform after all! 1.4.4.2 Resources C-MOOR Academy Discussion Forum How to add a bookmark in Chrome Discourse New User Guide 1.4.5 Activity 2 - Reply to a Topic in a Public Category Estimated time: 10 min 1.4.5.1 Instructions Navigate back to the C-MOOR Academy Discussion Forum front page.

PubMed offers tens of millions of peer-reviewed publications. This is a to go place for your scientific keyword searches! The vast majority of all microorganisms on Earth and beyond remain uncultured. As a result, their genomes (or metagenomes) are underdetected and understudied. As such, metagenomics is the ‘black box’ of genomics. Curiosity and threat of microbes are a great driving force behind the advances in the study of metagenomics, which is a culture-independent, direct approach to microbial sequencing and analysis of an environmental sample. In this module, we will learn about microbial diversity, the field of genomics and metagenomics and the role of sequencing technologies in metagenomic analysis. We will also learn how to read a scientific paper! In Prelab we will read a metagenomics Review paper to obtain a birds eye view of metagenomics from soil to gut and get an appreciation of the diversity and complexity of microorganisms, and of the challenges associated with identifying microorganisms. In Project activity, we will go deeper into scientific literature by reading a recent metagenomics Research paper and dissecting it from A to Z.

Broadly understand the scope of the review and the gaps in the field. 2.2.3 Introduction The vast majority of all micro-organisms on Earch remain uncultured (K.G. Lloyd et al, 2019). Additionally, in complex environments like soil and water, most micro-organisms remain unidentified (M. Delgado-Baquerizo, 2019). The field of metagenomics is a culture-independend approach which aims to remedy these gaps in knowledge (J. Handelsman, 2004). Metagenomics is the study of genomic (sequencing) data obtained directly from environmental (and other, e.g. clinical) samples and provides new meaningful information on the diversity and function of microorganisms. 2.2.4 Activity Estimated time: 50 min 2.2.4.1 Instructions Read the review paper “Metagenomics” by Sleator, Shortall, and Hill, 2008 Lett Appl Microbiol and answer the following questions. 2.2.4.2 Questions 1.

Despite their small size and having fewer number of coding genes, bacteria are more taxonomically diverse, more abundant and more successful in colonizing neew habitats - they are present in virtually every environment on earth!. This is in part due to bacteria having very ‘busy’ genomes with a high proportion of protein-coding functional genes and regions (and very little noncoding DNA and introns) which provide a source of innovation, novelty and adaptation e.g. by simply altering (mutating) functional genes (P.C. Kirchberger et al, 2020). In contrast, eukaryotic genomes mostly consist of noncoding DNA, and a lot of mutations are bound to occur in those abundant noncoding regions. In this Microbial Genomes module, we will learn about microbial genomes and microbial databases. In the Pre-lab activity, we will use E. coli to explore NIH genetic sequence database GenBank, bacterial databases such as BV-BRC and tree of life database Lifemap. For Project activity, we will continue microbial genome exploration using a published metagenome-assembled genomes or MAGs, which are microbial genomes assembled (reconstructed from) metagenome sequencing data. We will learn about the taxonomy of the MAG, its size, and assembly statistics and about its genes.

Due to the high complexity of metagenomics data, long-read shotgun sequencing offers many advantages over short-read sequencing for taxonomic classification. In this module, we will get a taste of long-read metagenomics sequencing data, and learn to classify and visualize taxonomy in Galaxy platform using tools like Kraken 2 to annotate and Krona plot to visualize taxonomy. This Taxonomy Profiling module offers hands-on experience with real data. We will use lecture material to learn about taxa and related concepts like taxonomic classification and species abundance. In the Activity portion of the module we will explore taxonomy of gut microbiome standard from Zymo Research using output of Kraken 2. This standard is a sample of known microbes with expected relative abundances. Through this activity we will become familiar with the structure of our taxonomy data and do some basic analyses. In Prelab activity, we will have a chance to perform taxonomy profiling ourselves using raw sequences from the gut microbiome standard on Galaxy platform to reproduce the results we analyzed in the previous activity, using the tools Kraken 2 (for assignment of taxonomy to sequencing reads) and Krona pie charts (for visualization). Subsequently, we will do a Project activity, where we will taxonomically classify a soil metagenome sample which serves as an example of an uncurated novel data. We will compare our results with the gut microbiome standard over a variety of metrics to learn what to expect when handling real data. "],["activity---taxonomy-profiling-spreadsheet.html", "4.1 Activity - Taxonomy Profiling Spreadsheet", " 4.1 Activity - Taxonomy Profiling Spreadsheet 4.1.1 Purpose Here we will have a hands-on experience with real taxonomy profiling data! We will explore the Kraken2 output for Zymo Gut Microbiome Standard and optionally compare to the Zymo Human Fecal Reference profile. We will introduce concepts of taxa and their relationships, begin familiarizing ourselves with data analysis goals to quantify the proportion of classified and unclassified species, identify the most abundant species, etc. See accompanying slides. 4.1.2 Learning Objectives Explore taxonomy with Kraken 2 taxonomic assignment output. Compare and contrast the taxonomy between the Zymo Gut Microbiome Standard and the Zymo Human Fecal Reference. 4.1.3 Introduction Metagenomics is the direct analysis of the genomes attained through genome sequencing of an environmental sample (soil, water, gut, etc). The purpose of the taxonomic classification of metagenomic sequences is to catalog, classify and identify the species inhabiting a given environment. In the process, we may even identify new species! After sampling, DNA extraction, DNA sequencing, and genome assembly, genome annotation is used to assign taxonomy to the sequenced DNA. Here is where the tool Kraken 2 comes in; Kraken 2 is a taxonomic classification tool which assigns taxonomy to sequencing reads. 4.1.4 Activity 1 – Explore Zymo Gut Standard Metagenomic Diversity The sample used in this activity is the Zymo Gut Microbiome Standard, sequenced by Pacific Biosciences using PacBio Sequel II Instrument, and corresponds to sequencing read file SRR13128014. A subset of this data is used in this Activity. Estimated time: 25 min 4.1.4.1 Instructions Access tax-data-gut.tsv and open it with Google Sheets here. Identify what information is provided in columns of the tax-data-gut taxonomy file. Col A = Counts Cols B-H = Taxonomic ranks k(Kingdom), p(Phylum), c(Class), o(Order), f(Family), g(Genus) and s(Species) Each row corresponds to a different taxa. There are 153 taxa that were classified for this sample. Create a header row and enter the above column information. 4.1.4.2 Questions 1. Evaluate what proportion of data was taxonomically classified. - Insert a new column A, name it &quot;Calculations&quot;, and temporarily use it for calculations. 1A. How many total counts are there? - In e.g. In cell A2, calculate the sum of all reads observed in the sample. 1B. What percentage of reads are unclassified? - In e.g. In cell A3, determine the percentage of unclassified reads. 1C. What percentage of reads are classified? - In e.g. cell A4, determine the percentage of classified reads. 2. Identify abundant taxa (those at &gt;1%). a. Select columns B through I. b. In the Data menu, select “Sort range by column B (Z to A)”. c. Insert a new column C, name it “% abundance”, and use it for temporary calculations. d. In the new column C, calculate % abundance for each row by dividing each count value by the total number of reads and multiplying by 100. e. Quantify abundant taxa. 2A. How many abundant taxa (at &gt;1%) do you observe? 3. List the abundant taxa you identified in a table below. - To consolidate the different abundant taxa, in e.g. new column D, copy the lower taxonomic rank identified for the abundant (at &gt;1%) taxa. - Then, enter the results into a table below. % abundance Taxonomy 20.1 s_Faecalibacterium_prausnitzii 4. How do your results overall compare with the expected taxa and % abundance from the Zymo gut standard? Compare your results with the expected taxa and abundance for the Zymo gut standard documentation?** Note, the Kraken 2 output does not distinguish different E. coli strains, so just combine them all into a single E. coli group! 5. Calculate ‘Low abundance’ for &lt; 1% abundant taxa by adding together the taxa at &lt;1%. What percentage of reads are classified as low abundance taxa? 6. Create a barplot of % abundance for your 12 abundant taxa via Insert Chart. Paste your barplot of % abundance for the 12 most abundant taxa below. 4.1.5 Activity 2 (OPTIONAL) – Compare results with the Zymo Fecal Reference Estimated time: 20 min 4.1.5.1 Instructions In this activity, repeat the steps of the Activity 1 above, but now using the tax_data_fecal.tsv dataset corresponding to the Zymo fecal reference. The tax_data_fecal.tsv dataset comes from a real human fecal sample, in contrast to the tax_data_gut.tsv sample you explored in the Activity 1, which corresponds to cultured and pooled known species combined at specific proportions to make up a predictable standard population. Perform the excercises from Activity 1 using the tax_data_fecal data, then, use questions below to compare the two datasets. See D6323 Zymo Fecal Microbiome References documentation (pg. 4) in the Resources section below. 4.1.5.2 Questions 1. Which dataset is classified better, gut or fecal? 2.

Assign taxonomy labels to your reads with tool Kraken 2. Visualize your metagenomic profiling using tool Krona to generate pie chart. 4.3.3 Introduction To find out which microorganisms are present in the sample, it is important to have high-quality DNA sequences. To ensure high-quality sequence input, QC (and in many cases also read trimming and filtering) are routinely performed on raw sequences. The reads can then be used for taxonomic classification. To assign taxonomy, we can compare the reads of the sample to a reference database, i.e. sequences of known microorganisms stored in a database, using Kraken 2, which is a k-mer based taxonomic assignment tool. We can then use a visualization tool Krona to interactively visualize and explore the composition of a metagenome. 4.3.4 Activity 1 – QC Reads Estimated time: 50 min 4.3.4.1 Activity 1 - Part I - Import the dataset into Galaxy Estimated time: 15 min 4.3.4.2 Instructions Import the dataset into Galaxy.

Running a workflow to perform taxonomy profiling and visualization of a soil metagenome. Throughout these objectives you will be comparing soil and gut metagenomes. 4.5.3 Introduction Note, the total time for a Galaxy step to complete depends on and will increase based on multiple factors such the input file size, a long queue when many other people are analyzing data, the complexity of the job itself and errors. See the table below for the minimum time a step will take for this assignment – be sure to start early as when Galaxy is busy each step can take 2-to-10 times longer to complete. Note, that you can save time by: Submitting multiple jobs that use the same input (NanoPlot and fastp) Submitting a job like the taxonomy workflow that uses the fastp output as input as soon as the output appears in your history even before the fastp job finishes.

Visualize contigs with the Bandage Image tool. Identify AMRs in the contig assemblies using the ABRicate tool. 5.2.3 Introduction Genome assembly is the process of reconstructing genomes from the DNA sequencing reads. Accurate and continuous genome assembly from sequenced fragments, even very long fragments, is challenging. Flye, is a long-read assembly algorithm that aims to produce highly contiguous genome assemblies and overcome some of the assembly challenges, like repetitive DNA sequences. Using Flye we will aim to reconstruct bacterial genomes and plasmids and enable detection of important genes implicated in anbibiotic resistance. Ideally, after assembly we want to get back circular contigs as that would typically indicate the identification of entire microbial genome(s) or plasmid(s)! Antimicrobial resistance is the ability of microbes to evade one or more antibiotics, leading to multidrug resistance and ability to survive and even thrive in the presence of antibiotics. Detecting and studying antibiotic-resistant pathogens is therefore extremely important to human health. However, the environmental reservoirs of resistance determinants are poorly understood. Certainly the indiscriminate and sometimes inappropriate use of antibiotics by humans (e.g. in the hospitals, in food production) has contributed to the emergence of resistant bacterial strains, but there are many other ways microbes can acquire AMRs. For example, the environment like soil is emerging as a key reservoir of these antibiotic resistance genes. For more information on AMRs see the following review articles: 10.1038/nrmicro2312 and 10.3390/antibiotics13121112.

You will also explore information about the taxonomic classifier GTDB-Tk. This will allow you to compare genomic assemblies and AMRs between soil and Zymo gut standard. 5.4.2 Learning Objectives Use Galaxy tools to Perform de novo genome assembly of long reads into ‘contigs’ useing Flye tool Visualize the contigs with Bandage tool Find AMRs in contig assemblies using ABRicate tool Bin contings into larger MAGS using MetaBAT2 tool Learn about GTDB-Tk taxonomy classifier tool 5.4.3 Introduction In this activity we will practice de novo metagenome assembly with the tool Flye, using a soil sample from the BioDIGS project sequenced with long-read Nanopore sequencing technology. We will have an opportunity to compare and contrast assembled contigs and antimicrobial resistance profiles of soil and gut and think about the differences and similarities in microbial diversity of the two environments. In this activity we will also learn about MetaBAT2 and GTDB-Tk. The most up to date long read metagenomics workflow includes contig assembly (e.g. using Flye tool), followed by contig binning into larger metagenome-assembled genomes (MAGs) (with e.g. MetaBAT2 tool) and finally MAG classification (e.g. with GTDB-Tk). MetaBAT2 is an algorithm that bins (or groups) sequence fragments (contigs) into larger MAGs or draft genomes. Subsequently, MAGs can be taxonomically classified by GTDB-Tk. You will not be executing GTDB-Tk in this activity to stay within a reasonable activity time frame. However, for your project work, you will have a chance to test GTDB-Tk on your genome assemblies and bins. A note to your future self working on a project - as a rule, after genome assembly, if your contigs are 500 kb or above, they will be considered large enough to be passed on to GTDB-Tk without the need for binning. Contigs of &lt; 500 kb will be binned and passed on to GTDB-Tk for taxonomy classification as bins. Overview of the approximate minimum times for a job to be completed on Galaxy using specified tools.

Explore Flye output assembly info file which is sorted by length (in base pairs, bp) of the contig (high to low). 5.4.4.2 Questions 1. How many contigs were assembled? Hint: Note: Since each contig is represented by a separate row (or line) in the assembly info file, simply clicking on the assembly info file and recording the number of lines listed in the file will correspond to the number of contigs. 2. What is the longest contig size? 3. What percent of input was assembled into contigs? Hint 1: In the log file, find the input number of bases going into flye assembly - this info corresponds to the “Total read length” value on top of the log file. Hint 2: In the log file, find the output number of bases after flye assembly - this info corresponds to the “Total length” value on the bottom of the log file. Hint 3: calculate percent of input assembled into contigs using the 2 input and output values you obtained above. 4. Why do you think only a small fraction of reads was assembled into contigs? 5. Compare soil assembly to the Zymo gut standard assembly provided the following observations: For this activity you can consult back to your Prelab: Finding AMRs. The number of contigs assembled from 342.5 MB of sequencing data from the Zymo gut standard D6331 subset was 289, much smaller than for the filtered soil sample of 5.5 GB! Yet, the largest contig size for the Zymo gut standard was over 2 million bases (almost 10 times larger) and circular (while the largest contig for the soil sample was smaller and linear). 5A. Why do you think the number of contigs in the soil sample was so much higher than the number of contigs in the Zymo gut standard? Hint 1: it is NOT because of the difference in the size of the sequencing file. Hint 2: Think about possible differences in the microbial diversity of the two samples. 5B. Why do you think it was possible to assemble a much larger and circular contig with the Zymo gut standard sample compared to the soil sample? 5.4.5 Activity 2 – Contig visualization with Bandage Estimated time: 15 min 5.4.5.1 Instructions Run Bandage Image tool in Galaxy to visualize contigs.

We chose a poster as our final deliverable in C-MOOR because they: Facilitate participation in research symposiums: Students can use their poster to apply to present at research symposiums or conferences with minimal additional effort beyond what they do in class. If your institution does not have a research day, consider starting one using these posters as a foundation as we did at Clovis Community College! Your school’s library is another great point of contact in getting a poster session or research day set up. Some of the events students have participated in using their C-MOOR projects include: The Clovis Community College Research Day The Notre Dame of Maryland University Research Day The GRADS-4C Conference (2025) Serve as a physical representation of student achievement: If printed, once finished with the class, students can choose to take their poster with them or leave it with the class to be hung up around the classroom or the hallways. This gives their research project more visibility, serves as an advertisement for other students who might be interested in taking the class, and showcases what students have accomplished. Can easily be shared digitally: A presentation can’t be repeated twice without a recording, and each recording can take up a lot of digital storage. A poster on the other hand, is a great compressed product that can be posted on a student’s (or the institution’s) social media and help get their work seen by others. Posters are even small enough that they can be attached to an email and sent to prospective supervisors and collaborators interested in a quick summary of their work. See our Look at This! category on the C-MOOR Academy Discussion Forum to see all the posters students have created and shared so far! Posters can be used to measure student achievement and understanding: We have previously used these posters to evaluate student learning, even years after students have left the classroom.

Poster is a powerful visual way to communicate new and exciting findings, share ideas and get feedback. No wonder Poster sessions are an integral part of any conference or symposium. Throughout research project work, students will work with their groups to put together a scientific research poster. 9.3.2 Part 1 - Choose a Template Estimated time: 5 minutes With your group, open a suggested poster template to use for your poster. Discuss with your group how you will divide up the work and exchange important information (e.g. phone numbers, email). Consider the following sections: Abstract/Introduction Methods Results Conclusions/Discussion References Acknowledgments Notice these posters are sized at 36 x 42 inches, but there are many other commonly used sizes. Refer to your instructor on what poster size to use; not every poster will fit every stand when printed (if applicable). Notice that the posters in this slidedeck come in two-column, three-column, and mixed formats. Think about your figures and tables and select a format that makes the most sense for them. There are also some example posters in the last two slides that we will use to examine the anatomy of a research poster further in the next part. 9.3.3 Part 2 - Make an Academic Research Poster Estimated time: — Complete the following components of your research poster with your group. You might not do them in this order, but these are the components you are being graded on. For more details on each of these sections and their role in a scientific paper, see the Scientific Literature Lab. 9.3.3.1 The header: title, authors, and affiliations Since you completed this work as a team of scientists, all of your team members are considered authors. List your team members in alphabetical order. The author’s affiliation is the university, college, research institution or company that the work was conducted at. An example affiliation for Clovis Community College would be: “Department of Biology, Clovis Community College, California, United States.” If multiple institutions exist, you will need to use superscript to denote who has what affiliation (see the example poster). We will include the C-MOOR logo, the logo of your institution(s), and the most immediately relevant funding source (if applicable) in the header. Check the header of your poster:  All authors are listed  All authors’ home institutions are referenced  The title of the poster is focused on your specific project topic (ex. genes, variables, model organism) The title of the poster describes the main result of your research The title of the poster does not overstate the findings or significance of your research  The C-MOOR logo is included  The logos of your institutions are included 9.3.3.2 Abstract C-MOOR Abstract examples: PacBio’s published abstract on ‘Genome-resolved metagenome assembly of human oral microbiome using highly accurate long-read sequencing’. An abstract is a concise summary of your work. An effective abstract will inform the reader of the relevant background to the research, scientific hypothesis being tested, the purpose of the study, the main methods, and the most important results and conclusions. Abstract can be difficult to write because it combines all research pieces and requires effective and consice communication of those sections. Many scientists choose to write the abstract last, after they fully understand the conclusions and implications of their work. Identify your scientific question, your hypothesis, and the knowledge gap (the unknown your research is addressing) first. Then brainstorm what you will need to tell your readers in terms of context and background. Your abstract should do the following: Include relevant background information such as: - A problem or question at hand - Model organism - The gene of interest and its function - The relevant phenotypes (e.g. disease-state) - The known connection between genotype and phenotype - Relevant biological processes Clearly state hypothesis, aims, and/or objectives of the research. - e.g. Our hypothesis is that the healthy gut microbiome has more microbial diversity than the gut of an individual with a celiac disease.` - e.g. We hypothesize that maternal antibiotic treatment correlates with higher antibicrobial resistance in infant microbiome.` Summarize or briefly mention methodology you used in your research. - e.g. Using Galaxy we analyzed the genomic diversity of the gut microbiome and compared fecal samples between individuals with Celiac Disease (CD) and a control group on a healthy diet without CD.` - e.g. We analyzed a publically available dataset comparing RNA-seq gene expression between the left and right eye in DESeq2.` Summarize the main results of your study, and how they may relate to the hypothesis. - e.g. We found that gene X was differentially abundant between the eye and all other tissues, suggesting gene X plays an important role in the eye. This may be important for learning more about eye development and X condition.` - e.g. We found an association between age and the presence of Y bacteria, which supports our hypothesis that Y bacteria is involved in the disease state` 9.3.3.3 Introduction Introductions typically appears immediately after the Abstract section and contains background information. Sometimes, an Introduction section can be used instead of the Abstract section, in which case, the Introduction will contain both, abstract information plus additional background information. An Introduction typically contains the relevant information and context needed to understand the study and the study’s hypothesis/aims/objectives and does not include the methodology, results, or takeaways from the study. 9.3.3.4 Materials and Methods The materials and methods section will detail your analysis of the data. Don’t provide any of your results, just the methods. If you did not generate the data yourself from raw samples, you will simply cite the paper that made them instead of detailing their construction. We will also need to list any programs we used and provide credit to their creators. Some other things you might include would be what type of analysis you decided to do (which parts of the body parts you analyzed, sets of genes, what p-value you used, etc.). 9.3.3.5 Results The Results section is where you will detail your data primarily through figures and tables, though sometimes written text is included. Begin by creating your tables and figures. Figure body: Has high resolution images, well spaced and labeled parts and text. Place the figures and tables in order of how you want to present them and name them such as Figure 1, Figure 2, Table 1, Table 2, etc. Figure Legend: Figures have their legends underneath them. Tables may have their legends also above them. The legend should be in a smaller font than the main text on the poster. A legend should includes a figure title, which is a declarative statement that summarizes findings. A legend also includes figure text which a) identifies (and can briefly describe parts), b) includes brief description of of methods necessary to understand figure and c) should include relevant statistics (stats). Optional components Figures and Tables can have additional (optional) text. E.g.an optional text can describe the findings of the figure upfront to engage. A Section Title/Header which summarizes section or figure in a manner that is broader than figure legend title - an attention grabber. Bullet pointed text that summarizes the main findings of the figures/tables. 9.3.3.6 Conclusions/Discussion The discussion section of the paper is your chance to analyze and interpret your results. The discussion section generally addresses the following: What do your results mean? How do they fit into the bigger picture? If any experiments did not give expected results, hypothesize why that might have been the case and propose alternate experiments that could confirm or clarify your results. Include at least one sentence of future work that you would do if you had more time or what students in upcoming semesters could do to continue to answer your questions. 9.3.3.7 References All the references that you cite on your poster must be present in a References section including the following sections: Introduction, Methods, and Discussion. To save space on our posters, we will number our references (ex. 1-5) and use the numbers as citations throughout the text of your poster. You may have a lot of references; it is okay to put them in tiny text if you have to in order to make them fit. There are many different ways to format the reference section. We will make ours in alphabetical order by the first author’s last name. All of your sources must be scientific journals and should use the following format: Authors (year) “Title.” Journal Name, vol. #, page #s, DOI Online article that is also in print: Haussecker D., Huang Y., Lau A., Parameswaran P., Fire A. Z. and M. A. Kay (2010) “Human tRNA-derived small RNAs in the global regulation of RNA silencing.” RNA, Vol. 16, page 637-695, doi:10.1261/rna.2000810 Online article only: Marianes, A. and A. C. Spradling (2013) “Physiological and stem cell compartmentalization within the Drosophila midgut.” eLife, doi:10.7554/eLife.00886 9.3.3.8 Acknowledgements The acknowledgements section is where you give thanks to the people, organizations, and institutions that have supported you in your research. If relevant, include the grant ID # of your funding source. Institutions and organizations that have contributed to your research - but you do not belong to - can be thanked here. 9.3.4 Part 3 - Proofread and Add Final Touches Estimated time: 30 min to an hour Each group member should re-read the poster from beginning to end and fix any typos or grammatical errors. Check the alignment of figures, text boxes, titles, etc. Add some finishing touches. You can play with the color, the font, add additional images if it’s relevant. 9.3.5 Part 4 - Canvas Discussion Estimated time: 30 min You will turn in your poster to be graded as a group in a Canvas Assignment and post it to a Canvas Discussion to be viewed by the class. Convert your poster to a pdf. Have one member of your group turn in the pdf of your poster to the Graded Canvas Assignment. This assignment is already set up so that if one group member turns it in, it will show as submitted for all students in the group. This is where your instructor will grade you poster as a group. Have one member of your group post a pdf of your poster in the Canvas C-MOOR Poster Discussion. With your poster, introduce your group members and copy and paste your abstract into the post. Insert your pdf into the post and edit the link so that it automatically shows the inline preview. This will make it easier for students to view your poster. As an individual, read through the other posters from different groups. Post comments 9.3.6 Grading Criteria Your instructor will provide for you a rubric specific to your class.

"],["create-your-cv.html", "10.4 Create your CV", " 10.4 Create your CV Estimated time: 10 min Everyone who completes a C-MOOR project can add their experience to their resume or CV! We advise you and your students to do this as soon as possible after the end of class while your research project is still on your mind. 10.4.0.1 Resume or CV? You may hear the terms resume and CV being used interchangeably. While both are drawn from the same information, they vary in brevity and focus. A resume is a one-page (sometimes two-page) document of your experiences generally used for jobs outside of academia and research labs. It’s not uncommon for people to have more than one resume, as it’s best to tailor every resume to each specific role you’re applying to. A Curriculum Vitae (CV) is an extensive document that can take as many pages as needed to list the entirety of your research and academic experience. It often includes sections that aren’t found in non-academic fields such as publications, conferences, and published papers. Most positions will detail which they require from applicants and most colleges and universities will be able to help you build either at your library or career center. We suggest that current students and recent graduates interested add their C-MOOR research experience to either their classwork or projects section. Remember to acknowledge the contributions of your team members if applicable; this does not count against you in your applications! Here are some examples of how you might word your experiences; notice how they’re similar to an abstract in just one or two sentences: An RNA-seq project: Along with a partner, examined differential expression data of the period (per) gene along the Drosophila melanogaster midgut from a published dataset (Marianes &amp; Spradling 2013) using DESeq2 and ClusterProfiler. We discovered an elevated expression of per in the anterior region of the midgut where the primary digestion and absorption of carbohydrates occur. Our results were presented as a research poster at the 2025 Kuntz Research Day symposium and have implications for using Drosophila as a model for the connection between the circadian rhythm and metabolic disorders. A 16S project: My group and I profiled the abundance of Archean ASVs in the gut microbiome from a published 16S study comparing the gut microbiota of people before, during, and after a standardized diet (Guthrie et al. 2022). As a part of this study, we created a PCoA and performed an alpha diversity analysis in phyloseq. Archean community members are often overlooked in microbiome studies; we found differential abundance in Methanobacteria between male and female participants regardless of diet and hypothesize this may be due to consumption of fiber reported by male subjects pre- and post-diet. A WGS project: Public data (SRA#######) from Robinson et al. (2021) was analyzed in Galaxy using Trimmomatic, Megahit, and Krona to determine the viral abundance in samples from tap water from various North American Lakes and make comparisons to lake depth. Viral abundance was correlated with geographic distance between samples; future studies could examine if this pattern persists in samples sourced from Europe and Oceana. Your blurb is a strong blurb when:   You credit the source of your data (Citation, SRA #, Project #)   You describe why your research project matters   You list some of the computational platforms or software you used Q: Will people think I am an expert in genomics and bioinformatics if I put my project on my resume/CV? I don’t want to look like a phony. A: As a current student or new graduate, you are not expected to have mastery over any scientific domain. What you are trying to show is you have taken an idea and brought it to completion, your ability to learn new concepts and skills, and your previous exposure to research. You can explain more about your role in the project in an interview. Q: Can I list things like R or Galaxy in my skills section? A: You can, however we suggest being explicit in your experience and add the level at which you feel comfortable with each respective platform. Are you R (Beginner) or R (Proficient)? Can you teach someone else how to do your project? Can you perform your project with novel data? How good are you at troubleshooting? This answer may seem contrary to the previous one, but remember that other people who are listing these platforms in their skills section includes computer/data scientists (majors) and bioinformaticians (majors), so people may assume mastery. Think about it the same way you would a foreign language. Spanish (Beginner) describes a different level of skill than ‘just’ Spanish.

Maybe you’re more interested in wet lab work, or a specific model organism. We encourage you to try all sorts of different opportunities even if you feel totally comfortable working with C-MOOR so you can better understand what kind of roles suit you best. This section serves as a guide for some common jumping off points to find outside research opportunities. 11.2.1 Research opportunities at your institution Many colleges and universities have research programs for their students or resources available to connect you to some. You can ask your instructor, adviser, or library for more information. Some popular programs include: Undergraduate Research Opportunity Programs (UROP): Which often provide a database or pipeline of research opportunities for students at the univeristy or from surrounding areas. Research experiences for undergraduates (REU): Similar to UROP, but generally open for a wider audience of students from outside the community. See the NSF REU website for more information. Opportunities come and go and often follow the academic-year in terms of availability. If you can’t find something immediately, keep trying! 11.2.2 Find a research lab to join You can choose to pursue additional research opportunities in what we consider the more traditional way: by reaching out to a professor or research scientist whose work you are interested in and asking if they might be willing to have you in their lab. As these opportunities are at the discretion of the lab leader they will vary widely in their scope, duration, and ability to provide financial support. An email to a potential research lab should contain:  An introduction about yourself (name, class year, institution, major)  1-2 sentences about your previous experience in research  1-2 sentences about why you’re interested in their lab specifically  A polite, open ended request to work with them Dear Professor Penguin, My name is Student, and I am a junior at My University majoring in biology (or other). I read your chapter on the genetics yellow-eyed penguins in Penguins: Natural history and conservation, and then checked out your profile on the University website. My interests are broadly defined in environmental toxicology and I am interested in the work you are doing using eDNA and studies on the effects of plastic on developing penguin transcriptomes. I previously completed a project as a part of an RNA-seq miniCURE and have some exposure to working with DESeq2, though I still have much to learn. My group and I profiled the gene expression of the genes XYZ in the Drosophila midugt and I presented our poster at our university’s research day poster session. Thank you for your time and consideration in reading my email. Please let me know if you are currently available to mentor an undergraduate in your lab and if you would be willing to have me as a potential student. I hope to hear from you soon! Don’t be surprised if it takes the researcher a while to get back to you or if they respond curtly. They likely get many requests and are very busy. Continue to reach out to labs and apply to programs; it is difficult to know when opportunities are available as funding fluctuates.
