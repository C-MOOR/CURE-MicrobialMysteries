C-MOOR miniCURE content overview.

### Course description {- .unlisted}

Microorganisms surround us, from the microbes in our soil to the bacteria in our digestive systems.  As part of the C-MOOR project [https://www.c-moor.org](https://www.c-moor.org), this Course-based Undergraduate Research Experience (CURE) introduces computational tools using Galaxy [https://usegalaxy.org](https://usegalaxy.org) and SciServer [https://sciserver.org](https://sciserver.org) to analyze metagenomic datasets that you will use to conduct independent projects.  Dig into soil metagenomics datasets generated by the GDSCN BioDIGS consortium [http://biodigs.gdscn.org](http://biodigs.gdscn.org) and study the soil biodiversity and ecological factors that impact human health and ecological concerns or explore publicly accessible human gut metagenomics datasets [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/bioproject](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/bioproject) and study how our microbiomes are shaped by our diet, medications, and genetics.

This course progresses through a series of in-person and online learning experiences that introduce important concepts and tools in data analysis and genomics, necessary to subsequently complete a Capstone Project. 
Students work in groups and present frequently during class periods similar to research lab meetings in order to receive and provide community analysis and feedback.  
This course is open to all students, regardless of major.  No prior computational experience necessary.

Microbial Mysteries CURE was offered at the Johns Hopkins University in the Spring of 2025 as AS.020.126.01.SP25 Microbial Mysteries: Genomics from Ground to Gut.

### Content overview {-}

The CURE is organized in two phases (Figure 2) which parallel our two groups of Learning Goals: (1) Employ the Tools of Modern Biology, and (2) Think Like a Scientist. Additionally, a Professional Development module is integrated into the two phases.

In the first phase, five core labs teach students how to “Employ the Tools of Modern Biology”, through tutorials, exercises and group work. These tools provide a necessary foundation from which students can develop and investigate their own scientific questions.

In phase 2, students learn to “Think Like a Scientist” by developing their own scientific projects. Equipped with the tools they learned in phase 1, students work in groups to generate and pursue scientific questions based on their exploration of the metagenomics data, culminating in a poster presentation. To help students succeed, we provide check-ins and structured lab times for students to work on their projects over the remainder of the course (see Project Work for details). This phase is more flexible; students benefit from dedicated lab time to work on their projects, but these opportunities for project work can be integrated into labs with short protocols or long wait periods.


- Microbial Mysteries CURE was offered at the Johns Hopkins University over the Spring Semester of 2025 lasting a total of 13 weeks (2 classes/sessions per week).
- Each class/session lasted 1 hour and 15 minutes.

Course content was organized broadly into 3 categories:

```
1. Phase 1 Core Labs - on weekly basis, Units 0 through 4 [ weeks 1-5]
2. Phase 2: Project Work   - over the course of 7-8 weeks [weeks 6-13]
3. Professional Development - over the course of 4 weeks integrated into Project Work
```

- Core units 0, 1, 2, 3 and 4, are fundamental knowledge and skills units that were taught over the coure of 5 weeks.

- Each core unit was typically associated with 1.5-2.5 hours of homework per class, or 3-5 hours of homework per week. The amount of homework is based on: 

a) For each hour of class students were generally expected to spend approximately 2 hours of independent study time (homework). 

b) To ensure meaningful coverage of important concepts and scientific content and computational skills necessary to proceed to next step and subsequently execute independent group project work.

#### Phase 2 - Project Work {- .unlisted}

Project work module is focused on research, and is mainly dedicated to group project work, with intervening Professional Development Sessions such as Scientific Talks. During their project work that spans ~8 weeks, students do research work towards their project, prepare and update relevant documents (e.g. Written Doc, poster slide deck) and separately meet with instructor to get help with project direction and execution and ask questions.

- <mark style="background-color: yellow">Students are expected to work on their project independently and with groups a minimum of 4 hours per week.
- <mark style="background-color: yellow">When there is no assignment due, students are still expected to work on their projects and update their posters.
- Project Work activities consist of **In-Class Round Table activities**, **Written Updates**, and **Advisory Meetings**.
